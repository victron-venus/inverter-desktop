# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.5.47] - Development line

### Added
- Ring-MQTT camera motion/ding handling via HA MQTT `camera_topic` wildcards and optional
  `ring_snapshot_url_template` (HTTP snapshot / HA camera_proxy). See `docs/ring-mqtt.md`.
- Per-plugin always-on-top video windows, disabled by default, and exclusions for
  individual legacy camera sources.
- Live Home Assistant camera previews from configured MQTT URL topics.
- Daily grid import and export in kWh beside the current tariff, using the
  controller's physical Victron meter readings. Partial days show their start
  time, and unavailable or stale readings remain unknown.

### Fixed
- Reject undersized RSA and ECDSA keys throughout the Apple-validated TLS
  certificate chain, including trust anchors omitted by the server.
- Desktop tariff exports use the system save dialog, avoiding a macOS WebKit
  download hang. Cancelling the export leaves the tariff draft unchanged.
- Camera previews start with less repeated work and discard stale queued live-preview frames.
- Configuration restore no longer leaks subscriptions or lets an older load
  overwrite newly restored settings. Plugin status refreshes coalesce event bursts.
- Plugin restoration avoids repeatedly verifying every installed package for
  each declaration while retaining integrity checks for the selected package.
- Local macOS updates stage the replacement application before stopping the old
  one and restore the previous bundle if replacement fails.
- The tariff spreadsheet uses matching Univer 1.0.2 packages, fixing builds that
  mixed incompatible Facade types. Dependabot now updates the Univer family together.
- The tariff in the daily statistics strip inherits the surrounding typography
  and stays inline with the other values.

### Changed
- Update Lucide icons and Prettier. Remove the unused direct Undici development
  dependency; jsdom keeps its compatible, patched Undici 7.29.1 dependency.

### Upgrade
- Windows HTTPS integrations require certificate chains with RSA keys of at
  least 2048 bits or ECDSA keys of at least 256 bits and SHA-2 signatures.
  Apple platform-verified connections require the same minimum key sizes,
  including the trust anchor. Replace undersized private CA keys or legacy
  signatures before upgrading; certificate trust and hostname verification
  remain enabled.
- Local authentication passwords migrate once to Argon2id verifiers while keeping
  the same login. This storage change is one-way: older app versions cannot
  unlock migrated profiles. Portable settings exports do not include credentials;
  see `docs/desktop-hardening.md` before intentionally downgrading.
- Application updates preserve the existing configuration, cached encryption key,
  plugin version pins and enabled/disabled choices. Camera packages remain managed
  separately through the Plugins settings.
- Keep the previous application bundle for rollback. Updating the app does not
  require exporting and importing configuration or enabling camera plugins.

### Maintenance

- Publish reviewed release notes from the exact source commit used to build each candidate, preserving build provenance.
- Document contribution checks, confidential security reporting and the project-specific trust boundaries.

### Security
- Apply explicit strong-sign policy to Windows' native certificate-chain
  builder for plugin downloads, media transfers and Home Assistant HTTP. Earlier
  native verification could accept weak intermediate and trusted-root keys.
- Replace reversible local login passwords with salted Argon2id verifiers,
  keep them out of settings IPC and exports, and atomically migrate the native
  configuration before granting access. Outbound service credentials are unchanged.
- Verify the official Gradle 8.14.3 wrapper and pinned distribution checksum before and after Android project generation.

Private vulnerability reporting and response policy are documented in SECURITY.md. This maintenance update strengthens release evidence and review instructions; it does not replace deployment authentication, network isolation or independent equipment safeguards. No new project CVE is announced by these changes.

## [2.5.41] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Android ARM64 and x86_64 builds align both load segments and RELRO boundaries
  for 16 KB memory pages, preventing failures caused by the earlier ARM64 boundary.

### Added
- A manual Google Play upload-bundle workflow with a separate upload key, complete
  signature verification, and native alignment checks. Existing GitHub APK signing
  identity is preserved; the workflow does not submit the app to Google Play.

## [2.5.40] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Installed iOS bundle and build versions now follow the app release version
  instead of the hardcoded `1.0.0` value.

## [2.5.39] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Clearing the MQTT host with IGW disabled now stops both inverter transports and
  clears their displayed telemetry. Home Assistant camera MQTT remains independent.
- Pending startup, reconnect and configuration operations cannot revive a removed
  inverter connection; callbacks from the previous session cannot overwrite new data.

## [2.5.31] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- Water pump/valve buttons now publish GX MQTT-API `W/<portal>/pump/<n>/Mode`
  (Cerbo `{"value": mode}`) instead of the unused `inverter/cmd/water_mode_set`
  topic; Mode read-back updates AUTO chips (#369).

### Added
- Manual pump/valve buttons in the Water card, routed through dbus-pump's
  writable `/Mode` (0 auto, 1 always-on, 2 always-off) via the GX MQTT-API
  (`W/<portal>/pump/<n>/Mode`) - still no direct Home Assistant control.
  Opening the city valve asks for confirmation; an AUTO chip appears while a
  device is under manual override to hand it back to dbus-pump automation.
- dbus-pump fix required on the GX: its `/Mode` onchange handler must return
  true, otherwise vedbus rejects the write and the mode silently stays `auto`
  (deployed as dbus-pump main).

### Changed
- EV section now sources data from Cerbo MQTT (dbus-ev / dbus-evcharger) instead of
  Home Assistant. Subscribes to `N/<portal>/ev/<instance>/Soc` (%),
  `N/<portal>/ev/<instance>/Ac/Power` (W), and
  `N/<portal>/evcharger/<instance>/Ac/Power` (W).
  New config fields: `evcharger_instance` (default 40) and `ev_instance` (default 22).
  The `ha_ev_soc_entity`, `ha_ev_charging_entity`, and `ha_ev_clamp_entity` config
  fields are removed. EV section visibility no longer requires HA direct API — it shows
  when Cerbo MQTT is connected and at least one EV metric is live.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Portal ID auto-discovery: subscribes to the retained `inverter/portal`
  topic published by inverter-control and arms water/alarm subscriptions and
  the GX keepalive automatically - `portal_id` is now optional in app config.

### Changed
- Water section now uses **only** Cerbo GX MQTT (dbus-pump): the Home Assistant
  entity fallback (`ha_water_level_entity` / `ha_valve_switch_entity` /
  `ha_pump_switch_entity`) is removed, along with its config fields
- Water card shows level in % plus pump/valve status badges; toggle buttons
  removed — pump/valve automation lives in dbus-pump

## [2.4.4] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- Solar forecast display (#252) and forecast brackets in DailyStats (#251)
- Yesterday solar production (#241)
- Washer/dryer START/PAUSE buttons from HA button entities (#247)
- Persistent notification banner + Victron alarm watcher (#244)

### Fixed
- Tray icon keeps updating after poisoned lock, panic, or sleep/wake (#255)
- Solar breakdown now adds up to headline total (#254)
- Existing config/about windows brought to front on reopen (#253)

### Security
- Bump glob override to 11.1.0 (CVE-2025-64756) (#250)

## [2.4.3] - unreleased

### Fixed
- Various fixes and dependency updates

## [2.2.2] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- CI build failure: remove empty Apple code signing env vars causing `SecKeychainItemImport` error
