# Electricity tariff editor

The controller is the default source of electricity prices for the installation.
Every dashboard consumes `ui_config.electricity_tariff`; saved browser or older
application-configuration plans no longer override it automatically. Public
read-only dashboards display the controller tariff and expose no editing.

In an updated desktop/mobile app, **Configuration → Electricity tariff** edits
the shared plan immediately on inverter-control. The dashboard's **Set tariff**
or **Edit tariff** opens the same editor when the controller supports writes.
Saving waits for a matching controller acknowledgement after atomic persistence;
a stale revision, validation failure or disk error leaves the previous plan intact.
Both direct MQTT and the updated authenticated inverter-gateway transport support
this command. A disconnected/older controller cannot claim successful saving.
The web dashboard displays the shared plan; use the application or controller's
installation tools to edit it.

Choose **Use a local tariff on this device** explicitly for a standalone local
copy. That choice is scoped to the current view and returns to the controller
on reload or installation change. Existing local data is preserved for export
and import; it is never silently uploaded to the controller. **Use controller
tariff** returns to the shared plan. Tariff editing never changes inverter control
flags, charging policy or Emporia settings.

The Univer spreadsheet loads only when opened. Rows are half-hour periods,
Monday–Sunday in the tariff's IANA time zone. Prices are currency units/kWh,
not cents. Zero and negative prices are valid; blank, text, nonfinite and formula
cells are rejected. Cancel discards the draft. JSON import/export moves a plan
without account credentials. No initial numeric price is suggested.

For a flat tariff, daily grid kWh produces an explicitly approximate energy cost.
For time-of-use tariffs, the strip shows the current rate; a daily cost needs
interval consumption and is deliberately unavailable from a daily total alone.
The former hard-coded USD 0.31/kWh estimate has been removed. Taxes, fixed fees,
demand charges and consumption tiers are outside this energy-rate model. The editor does not invent any initial rate.

## Seasons and billing periods

A version 2 tariff contains a default weekly `rates` grid and a `seasons` array.
Each season has a `name`, distinct calendar `months` (1–12) and its own complete
48×7 `rates` grid. Months may not overlap. Months without an override use the
default grid. The editor opens the schedule active now; switching schedules
commits any cell being edited before showing the other grid. Import and export
retain all schedules, including those not currently visible. Use **Add season** to create a schedule, enter its name and select calendar
months. Edit its weekly prices or fill the selected week. **Remove this season**
removes only that draft override; the default schedule then covers those months.
All seasons must have nonoverlapping months before saving.

An optional `billingDay` (integer 1–31) starts the billing period in the tariff's
time zone. For example, day 17 on September 24 displays September 17–October 16.
Short months clamp days 29–31 to the last calendar day without shifting later
months. This is the period start, not the payment due date. Season prices still
switch at local midnight on the first of their months, even mid-billing-period.
The displayed period is not a calculated invoice: time-of-use totals require
interval consumption. Billing dates alone cannot reconstruct that consumption.

Legacy version 1 weekly files and stored plans remain readable and migrate to
version 2 without assuming a billing date. The storage key remains unchanged.
Old app versions reject version 2 instead of silently treating seasonal prices
as year-round prices. Update the receiving app before importing a new export.

## Controller persistence and migration

The controller stores the shared plan at
`/data/setupOptions/inverter-control/electricity-tariff.json`. It survives controller
updates. Clearing it writes an explicit `null`, preventing an older fallback file
from silently restoring a removed plan. Runtime edits apply without restarting
the control service. Offline CLI/deployment edits take effect at service restart.

Older `victron.energy-tariff` application modules remain in portable configuration
backups for data preservation, but are not active pricing sources. First-run app
setup now defers tariff configuration until a controller connection exists. Export
and import a reviewed legacy plan explicitly to migrate it; there is no automatic
upload that could overwrite a newer controller plan. Local browser files remain
available through the explicit local mode.

See the [controller installation and deployment guide](https://github.com/victron-venus/inverter-control/blob/main/docs/electricity-tariffs.md)
for SetupHelper, compact schedule files, validation and `TARIFF_FILE` provisioning.

## Emporia import

The companion `dbus-emporia-vue/scripts/export_tariff.py` reads the existing
configured device's `locationProperties` endpoint and emits only tariff fields.
Run it on the machine that already holds the driver's configuration and tokens:

```sh
python3 scripts/export_tariff.py --config /path/to/config.json \
  --device-gid 12345 --currency USD --output emporia-tariff.json
```

Use the actual configured device ID and the currency shown in the Emporia app.
Import the resulting JSON with **Import tariff**. The exporter refuses to
replace an existing file and never includes credentials or address fields.
The output must be a JSON filename without directory components; the file is
created in the current working directory with owner-only permissions.

A nonempty `utilityRateGid` identifies a selected utility plan; the available
PyEmVue device-properties contract does not provide the plan's time-of-use
schedule. Such an import retains the plan reference and leaves price cells
blank. Copy the actual schedule from the Emporia app, review it, and save.
It never treats `usageCentPerKwHour` as a complete TOU plan. For a legacy flat
plan without a utility plan ID, cents are converted to currency/kWh explicitly.

## Implementation

The tariff model, spreadsheet and display components are mirrored between
inverter-dashboard-vue and inverter-desktop. Native controller transport lives
only in the desktop/mobile build. Univer OSS packages are pinned to
1.0.0; no paid import/export or server plugin is required. The heavy editor is a
separate lazy chunk. JSON is the exchange format; XLSX is not part of this feature.
The browser stores local overrides per origin; desktop additionally scopes them by
portal ID (falling back to gateway or MQTT host). No cloud synchronization runs.

Validation covers rates, missing data, source metadata, separate scopes, storage
failure, season changes, pending-cell preservation, short-month billing boundaries
and local-time/DST selection. Run the existing frontend build and test
commands after changing the mirrored files.

## Measured interval energy cost

Open **Interval energy cost** beside the dashboard tariff button. Import measured
grid-import CSV or JSON to calculate energy charges for a selected local date or
billing period. The shared calculator applies seasonal/weekday prices and DST,
reports missing duration, and excludes intervals crossing a price or date boundary
without inventing their within-interval consumption. A partial subtotal is visibly
marked and never presented as a full bill. See the [complete import format, provider
data preparation, limits and coverage guide](https://github.com/victron-venus/inverter-dashboard-vue/blob/main/docs/electricity-tariffs.md#measured-interval-energy-cost).

Readings stay in local browser/webview storage, scoped to the dashboard installation.
Import replaces that installation’s history; invalid input and storage failures
preserve the previous copy. They are not included in configuration backups, tariff
exports or controller uploads. Keep original exports for durable archival. Emporia
currently has no gross-import chart-history source in its upstream API client;
net mains energy and sampled grid power are not accepted substitutes. Automatic
history synchronization is not provided.
